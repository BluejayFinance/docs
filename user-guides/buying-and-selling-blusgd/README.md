# Buying and selling bluSGD

There are two options available to you for buying or selling bluSGD: \
\
1\. [via Uniswap](buying-and-selling-blusgd-via-uniswap.md) or \
2\. [via the Peg Stability Module (PSM)](buying-and-selling-blusgd-via-peg-stability-module-psm.md). \
\
With Uniswap, you can easily swap your existing assets to bluSGD. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies directly with other users on the platform.&#x20;

On the other hand, the PSM module enables you to swap between bluSGD and other stablecoins with minimal slippage. The PSM starts with xSGD, a stablecoin pegged to the Singapore Dollar.&#x20;

Both Uniswap and the PSM are efficient ways to buy or sell bluSGD depending on your needs and preferences.
