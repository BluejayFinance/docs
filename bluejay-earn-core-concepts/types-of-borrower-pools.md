# Types of Borrower Pools

### Permissionless Pools

These are borrower pools which were created permissionless-ly. Similarly to how Uniswap enables anyone to create a market between two different assets, Earn protocol enables anyone to create a borrower pool.

Lenders are strongly encouraged to perform extensive due diligence before making a decision.

### Facilitated Pools

Bluejay's Business Development team is also actively sourcing for high-quality borrowers across Asia. The team will be taking the role of a facilitator in helping the borrower to create a borrower pool and also in helping them with operational requirements during the loan tenure. Please note that Bluejay is only taking on the role of a facilitator and are not liable for any damage, loss of profit, or accuracy of information provided.
