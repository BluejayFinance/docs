<summary>What is the pBLU token? Can I get it?</summary>

The pBLU token is distributed to early supporters of the protocol when we were fundraising to build Bluejay. It is vested linearly to the supply of BLU tokens.

Information about the token can be found [here](https://medium.com/bluejay-finance/what-is-pblu-fda9e17c8d69).\

Since pBLU is non-transferable, unless you have supported the project since as early as 2021, it is unlikely you can access pBLU.

<summary>Does that mean that investors can dump pre-minted tokens on me?</summary>

Projects and companies require significant capital to materialize their vision and this happens when they are fundraising. Early investors undertake large amount of risk to support a vision early on and are compensated in either shares or tokens which can easily become worthless if the team fails to execute.

In hindsight, it is often easy to comment that investors are dumping on you and that they have gotten in early to the deal. However, it is not easy to make that decision to deploy capital when the project is less mature.

In similar manners, you will be able to invest in the Bluejay ecosystem and our vision at the current price of BLU tokens, and exit at a premium if we are able to execute on our vision down the road.

You do not need to be a BLU holders in order to enjoy benefits of Bluejay’s ecosystem. As a non-BLU token holder, you will still be able to get access to the entire range of products we offer, including Bluejay Earn.
