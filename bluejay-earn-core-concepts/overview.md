# Overview

### Summary

* Bluejay Earn is a decentralised peer-to-peer credit protocol.
* Lenders can participate in any borrower pool available to lend out their bluSGD, without minimum capital requirement, to borrowers at a fixed interest rate over the duration of that borrower pool.
* Borrowers can directly raise funds from lenders by creating borrower pools and leverage DeFi as a source of efficient capital.

### Key Problems

**Business and individuals lack access to credit**

The credit gap in Asia is a significant issue, with over 60% of people in Southeast Asia being underbanked and lacking access to formal financial services such as credit. This lack of access to credit is particularly challenging for business owners, who often require funding to grow and expand their operations. However, many of these businesses are unable to obtain the financing they need because of the complex transaction costs, processes, and due diligence requirements involved in obtaining loans.

The root cause of these challenges is that the existing financial system is not designed to serve the needs of those who lack access to credit. Instead, it is structured to meet the needs of those who already have the means to succeed. This leaves small businesses in the region, which contribute a large portion of the GDP and employ most of the local talent, without the means to access the financing they need to take their businesses to the next level.&#x20;

**Investors lack access to a variety of financial products**

On the flip side, investors who are looking to protect and grow their wealth across this region are also limited on opportunities in which they can invest as the barriers to entry to participate in those opportunities, such as minimum capital requirement as much as 200k, are simply too high.

### Bluejay’s Approach

Bluejay is on a mission to tackle the credit gap problem in Asia by building a decentralized peer-to-peer credit protocol. The Earn protocol is designed to empower emerging market economies for both lenders and borrowers, providing a sustainable solution to the credit gap problem in Asia.

Bluejay Earn matches the demand for capital from small businesses across Asia with the supply of capital from investors who are looking to generate sustainable yield from real economic activities. This creates a win-win situation for both parties, as small businesses are able to access the financing they need to grow, and investors are able to generate a return from their investments.

Bluejay is focused on empowering emerging market economies by providing a platform that is accessible to both lenders and borrowers. With Bluejay Earn, lenders will have access to opportunities that are typically not available to them. This gives them the chance to invest in real economic activity, generate a sustainable return, and make a positive impact on the world. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to raise capital through Bluejay Earn, giving them the resources they need to take their businesses to the next level.

### Stakeholders

The protocol depends on two groups of stakeholders, the lenders and borrowers

**Lenders** provide capital by lending their bluSGD stablecoins into various borrowing opportunities (“Borrower Pools”). This enables lenders to earn fixed interest rate on the stablecoins that they have lent out.

**Borrowers** propose and raise capital by creating borrower pools in which the lenders can deposit their bluSGD stablecoins. Borrowers generate yield for lenders from real productive usage to accelerate their economic growth.
