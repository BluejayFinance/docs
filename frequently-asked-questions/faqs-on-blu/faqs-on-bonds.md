<summary>What does the different terms in buying bonds mean?</summary>

* Principal - Amount of BLU you get when this bond is fully redeemed
* Maturity - Time left before the full value of BLU can be redeemed
* Redeemable - Amount of BLU that you may redeem right now even if the bond has not fully vested

<summary>Why does the principle and maturity change after redemption?</summary>

The principle and maturity value of the bond will be updated to reflect the vesting schedule of the remaining BLU.

Once you have redeemed a partially vested bond, you will receive the amount of BLU that has been vested and the principal value will be reduced by that amount.

Similarly, the maturity period will be reduced by the time elapsed since the bond was purchased, or last redeemed, to reflect the remaining time for the bond to fully vest.

<summary>Why do I not get all the BLU immediately after buying bonds?</summary>

Every bond you buy has a maturity period and you will receive the full amount only when the maturity period has passed.

You may, however, redeem a portion of the bond value at any time to receive any BLU that has been linearly vested.

<summary>Why should I buy BLU bonds?</summary>

Bonding is a process to allow Bluejay to acquire its own liquidity and reserve assets (ie DAI) and bring stablecoins to the peg by selling BLU at a discount.

You may buy BLU bonds if you want to trade assets you have to get BLU tokens at the discounted price after the vesting period.

Do note that since as you are effectively purchasing the BLU tokens, you are exposed to the volatility of the BLU token price. Please read section on “**Why should I buy BLU**” and “**Why is BLU price going up/down?**”

<summary>How long are bonds vested for and how did we determine that time period?</summary>

The maturity period for stabilizing bonds is 6 hours, while the maturity period for treasury bonds is 7 days. BLU tokens will be available for redemption throughout the entire maturity period, but only up to the proportion that has been vested.

The maturity period for both types of bonds are determined by the monetary policy set by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

<summary>Will we be launching other bonds in the future? What are the types of bonds you could purchase today?</summary>

Bluejay do not have intention to launch other bonds as of today.

There are two main types of bonds on Bluejay, treasury bonds, and stabilizing bonds. The only difference is that treasury bonds raise assets for the treasury directly while stabilizing bonds help to peg issued stablecoins to their prices.

<summary>Why should I purchase the bond instead of holding BLU or holding the LP tokens directly?</summary>

You should purchase the bond if the effective price of BLU is suitable for you. Do take note that the market price of BLU may change during the maturity period of the bonds when purchasing it

You should hold the LP tokens if you believe the fees generated from your stake in the liquidity pool will meet your expected returns.

If you do not understand the risk associated with such activities, you are discouraged from participating.
