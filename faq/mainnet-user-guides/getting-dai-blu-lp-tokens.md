# Getting BLU/DAI LP Tokens

Other than using DAI for the bonds, you can also use liquidity provider tokens to purchase the bonds. Liquidity provider tokens are tokens that represent your stake in automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap.

In this guide you will learn how to provide equal value of DAI and BLU to an Uniswap liquidity pool to obtain the BLU/DAI LP token which can be used to purchase a treasury bond from Bluejay.

## Why do we need LP Tokens?
