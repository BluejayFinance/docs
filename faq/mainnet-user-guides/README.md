## Bluejay Finance Mainnet

Bluejay Finance is the first Asia-focused protocol for decentralized stablecoins pegged to local fiat currencies.

The introduction of USD stablecoins has allowed individuals and businesses to gain access to a variety of financial services like money exchanges, savings,etc. However, 99% of stablecoin solutions are centred around USD which means that users do not have a choice of having exposure to currencies other than USD in the DeFi space.

At Bluejay, our mission is to mirror the foreign exchange market in the fiat world onto the blockchain, in order to accelerate financial inclusion and access to DeFi for all users and businesses.

Please follow the [user guides](buying-bonds.md) to use all functionalities of the protocol and you are welcome to provide feedback and comments on our [discord](https://discord.gg/4DMsg555KT) channel.\
