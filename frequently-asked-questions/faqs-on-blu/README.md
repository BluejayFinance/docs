# FAQs on BLU

BLU is a governance token and one of the core functions of the BLU token is to allow for the automatic capitalization of the treasury, which in turn allows for the supply expansion of bluStables.

<summary>What is the supply of BLU?</summary>

Similar to how there are no supply cap to company’s share, there is no limit to the supply of BLU. This allows the protocol to perform recapitalisation when necessary to raise funds for future expansions or perform buyback when growth targets are met.

<summary>Why is the team not focused on BLU price?</summary>

The team is focused on delivering the best suite of products to provide access to financial services, the same way that companies in the real world are focused on value creation for their customers instead of just their share prices.

Bluejay is similar to an early startup and investing in the governance token is highly speculative. While the team has deep appreciation for early supporters for the protocol, we do not want to draw excessive attention to simply trading BLU or inventing schemes that manipulates the prices of BLU in unsustainable manners.

At the present moment, we are focused on building on the product, [Bluejay Earn](https://app.bluejay.finance/earn).

<summary>Why are you on Ethereum where gas fees are expensive? Any plans to expand to L2s?</summary>

Here are the key reasons why we are deployed on Ethereum:

* Ethereum has the highest amount of liquidity across all L1s and L2s. Liquidity is important in the early stages of the protocol.

<!---->

* One of the strongest security layers which both users and the protocol can benefit from.

If the market demonstrates demand for Earn, we will be deploying it on the relevant layers.

<summary>Why are the staking yields at 35% right now? It seems high for a stablecoin.</summary>

The staking yields are on the **BLU token** right now, not on **bluSGD**. They are at this level because they reflect the growth projection of the protocol, and also help reward earlier users.

bluStables does not have a staking yield. Instead, holders of bluStables may earn yield on the stablecoins by investing them in deals on the Bluejay Earn page.

<summary>What price did early investors buy the token at?</summary>

Bluejay launched a public sale to bootstrap its liquidity in November 2022. Whitelist price was set at $5 while the public sale price was $10.

The core team has separately raised money to fund software development efforts.

<summary>How Is the protocol capital-efficient? Are there any incentive programs for stablecoin holders?</summary>

The protocol is capital efficient in a sense that it does not always rely on external funding to operate and grow.

The protocol makes revenue from both arbitrage and swap fees. This mechanism allows the protocol to utilize its revenue generated to operate and grow. You can check out this article for more information [here](https://medium.com/bluejay-finance/bluejays-flywheel-effect-and-why-you-d-want-to-become-a-blu-governor-b035af23ddb0).

Stablecoin holders are able to participate in exclusive Bluejay Earn products. Loan pools denominated in bluStables do not incur any fees so all the yield from the borrowers goes directly to the bluStables holders.

<summary>Why is the protocol modelled after Olympus or Wonderland?</summary>

We aim to be a sustainable business, which is why we have a focus on real world finance / RWA use cases.

But we also like the protocol-owned liquidity approach of certain protocols because they allow them to be more flexible at deploying capital, rather than relying on liquidity mining incentives.

The failure of OHM and Wonderland came from highly inflationary tokenomics and no meaningful deployment of that capital into revenue-generating businesses, similar to a startup that raises series A in capital and then doesn't spend that money at all in its core business.

Bluejay reworks the model by ensuring that we have a sound business model by providing products that create values for our users and then extracting the value in a sustainable manner.

<summary>Comparison with other protocols</summary>

To quickly understand the similarities and differences between Bluejay Finance and some of the more familiar protocols, please refer to our [Protocol Comparison](https://docs.bluejay.finance/faq/protocol-comparison).

<summary>What are the initial pools BLU are traded? Why is the liquidity so low?</summary>

BLU tokens are available to be traded on Uniswap V2. The pool was deployed by the protocol during the token generation event, during which 50k of liquidity was deployed by the protocol to facilitate trading in the secondary market.

The decision to deploy that level of liquidity is so that the rest of the capital can be used meaningfully by the product instead of facilitating speculative trading which does not create value for the ecosystem in the long term.

<summary>Why should I buy BLU?</summary>

You should buy BLU if you:

* Believe in the mission of Bluejay, or
* Believe that the team’s capability in executing our vision, or
* Believe in the business model of Bluejay, or
* Are speculating that the price will go up, for any other reasons

As BLU is a speculative asset, we do not actively encourage users who do not understand what they are getting into to participate in speculative activities.

If you are unable to understand the risk associated with purchase of BLU, we strongly discourage you from doing so.

<summary>Why is BLU price going up/down?</summary>

The likely answer is: “We do not know”.

There are many reasons why there are increased market activities surrounding the BLU price, including but not exclusive to:

* Speculative trade from individuals or groups of individuals,
* Effects of a large buy or sell orders from individuals or earlier BLU token holders,
* Price dampening effects of the liquidity captor, see [here](https://medium.com/bluejay-finance/capturing-speculative-trade-as-value-for-token-holders-with-liquidity-captor-d492ac3b6a7e)

The team has not, and will not ever be, guaranteeing a directional price movement or redemption price of the BLU token.
