# Connecting to Rinkeby Network

Bluejay Protocol is deployed on a separate test network named Rinkeby. This allows you to test out the features of the protocol without spending real ETH. To get started we will be creating a new account on Metamask wallet as previous accounts cannot be used for the Bluejay Testnet.

Follow this guide to set up your Metamask wallet to connect to the test network.

## **Connecting to Rinkeby**

To connect your Metamask wallet to the Rinkeby Test network, follow the steps given below.

1. Click on the top right circle to open the “My Accounts” menu and then click on “Settings”.

## Connect to Bluejay Testnet Site

To check if the wallet has connected to the Rinkeby Test Network, we can open the [Bluejay Testnet Site](http://testnet.bluejay.finance).

You will be greeted with a warning pop-up. Do take 2 mins to read through it carefully. If you have read and agree with the terms of use, click on the tick box and press “Enter”.

Once you have entered the test net site, click on “Connect Wallet”.

The green light is an indication that your wallet is connected to the Rinkeby Test Network and it will work on the Bluejay Testnet site.

Once we have connected to both the Rinkeby Test Network and Bluejay Testnet site, we require test ETH and DAI to play around. Head over to “[Getting ETH & DAI on Rinkeby](getting-eth-and-dai-on-rinkeby.md)” to get started and interact with the Bluejay Testnet site.
