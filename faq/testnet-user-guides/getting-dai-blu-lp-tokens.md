# Getting DAI/BLU LP Tokens

Other than using DAI for the bonds, you can also use liquidity provider tokens to purchase the bonds. Liquidity provider tokens are tokens that represent your stake in automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap.

In this guide you will learn how to provide equal value of DAI and BLU to an Uniswap liquidity pool to obtain the DAI/BLU LP token which can be used to purchase a treasury bond from Bluejay.

## Why do we need LP Tokens?

To purchase DAI/BLU LP Treasury Bonds you will need to provide liquidity on Uniswap using DAI and BLU tokens. Therefore before purchasing LP Treasury bonds, make sure you have obtained BLU and DAI tokens in your wallet. If not follow these steps before proceeding:

1. [Getting ETH & DAI on Rinkeby](getting-eth-and-dai-on-rinkeby.md)
2. [Buying and Selling BLU on Uniswap](buying-and-selling-blu-on-uniswap.md)
