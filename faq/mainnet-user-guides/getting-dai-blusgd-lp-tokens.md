# Getting bluSGD/DAI LP Tokens

## Why do we need LP Tokens?

To purchase a bluSGD/DAI LP Treasury Bond, we need to provide liquidity on Uniswap using bluSGD and DAI tokens. Therefore before purchasing LP Treasury bonds, make sure you have obtained DAI and bluSGD tokens in your wallet.

## Getting bluSGD/DAI LP Token

Follow these steps to get the bluSGD/DAI LP token:

1. Go to Bluejay site “Dashboard” and click on “**Wallet**” in the top right corner.

Then proceed to follow the same steps you did to get BLU/DAI LP tokens([here](../testnet-user-guides/getting-dai-blu-lp-tokens.md#getting-dai-blu-lp-token)).

Click on “**Approve bluSGD**”, and then confirm the transaction on the Metamask pop-up.

Then click on “**Supply**” and approve the transaction through the Metamask pop-up.
