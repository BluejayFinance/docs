# Types of Loan Pools

### Permissionless Pools

These are loan pools which were created permissionless-ly. Similarly to how Uniswap enables anyone to create a market between two different assets, Earn protocol enables anyone to create a borrower pool.

Investors are strongly encouraged to perform extensive due diligence before making a decision.

{% hint style="info" %}
Permissionless pools are not yet available in the beta launch.&#x20;

### Facilitated Pools

Bluejay's Business Development team is also actively sourcing for high-quality borrowers across Asia. The team will be taking the role of a facilitator in helping the borrower to create a loan pool or in helping them with operational requirements during the loan tenure. Please note that Bluejay is only taking on the role of a facilitator and are not liable for any damage, loss of profit, or accuracy of information provided.&#x20;
