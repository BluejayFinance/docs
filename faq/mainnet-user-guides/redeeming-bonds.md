# Redeeming Bonds

A bond takes some time for it to be vested (or to be matured). Once a bond is matured, you can redeem BLU. You can learn more about [Bonding here](https://docs.bluejay.finance/basics/bonding).

In this guide, we will go through how you can redeem a portion of your bond value and get BLU that has been linearly vested.

## Where to Redeem Bonds

Head over to “**Bonds**” section from your left navigation bar and scroll down to the bottom of the page. If you had purchased bonds before, you should be able to see the “**Purchased Bonds**” section below.

You may redeem the BLU tokens as they mature or wait until the tokens are fully vested before redeeming them.

## How to Redeem Bonds

The “Redeemable” column shows how much BLU you can redeem at that certain period of time.

Follow the steps below to redeem BLU:

1. Since we previously purchased DAI Treasury Bond, we can click on the “**Redeem BLU**” button beside the DAI Treasury Bond.

If you have purchased several bonds, you can also click on “**Redeem All**” to redeem many bonds at the same time.

Apart from redeeming your bonds as BLU, you may also have the protocol stake it for you and receive sBLU instead.&#x20;

Head over to “[Staking BLU](staking-blu.md)” to start generating a yield on your redeemed BLU.
