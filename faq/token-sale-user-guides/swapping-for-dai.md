# Swapping for DAI

Sending transaction on the Ethereum network requires  ETH for gas. You will also require DAI to purchase BLU and interact with the protocol.&#x20;

In this guide, you will learn how to swap for DAI with your existing assets to begin interacting with Bluejay protocol.

Head over to [https://app.bluejay.finance/sale](https://app.bluejay.finance/sale).\
Once you confirmed and accept the **Terms of Use**, you should see something like the following:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (1)>)

You can simply go to “**Swap”** from the left menu or click the link from Buy BLU section. You will be redirected to a page as shown below. We are using the Uniswap widget to make it more convenient for users to swap assets.

### **Approve DAI**&#x20;

You may be prompted to “Approve DAI” before proceeding to swap.&#x20;

Follow the instructions below to approve DAI:&#x20;

1. Click on “**Approve DAI**”.

Note that this is a one-time transaction to allow spending of DAI for buying BLU tokens. Make sure you have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet for gas fees.
