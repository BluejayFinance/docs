## Before Buying Bonds

First, you need to be connected to Ethereum Mainnet and make sure that you have some ETH and DAI in your wallet. If you don't have DAI ready in your wallet, please refer to this on [swapping for DAI](broken-reference).

## Navigating to Bonds Page

Once you have some ETH and DAI in your Wallet, head over to [app.bluejay.finance](https://app.bluejay.finance). You should see something like the following:

The left sidebar contains all of our main functionalities. This is also where you will be able to find a list of bonds that are available for sale. You can also view the discounts of each bond at a glance through the sidebar.

You can click on either “**Bonds**” or go directly into a specific bond that you’d like to purchase (e.g. DAI bond).

Note: All of our Stabilizer Bonds would be labeled Stabilize \<Stablecoin Name>.

For the purposes of this guide, let’s go ahead and buy some DAI bonds.

## Approving DAI to Purchase Bonds

Even though you have DAI in your wallet, it is not possible to directly purchase some bonds. To start buying the DAI Treasury Bond, you will first have to approve DAI.

Follow the instructions below to approve DAI:

1. Click on “**DAI**” on the left side bar.

2\. You should see something like the following. Click on “**Approve DAI**”, note that this is a one-time transaction to allow spending on DAI for buying bonds. Make sure you get some ETH in your wallet.

Once a bond is matured, you can click on either “Redeem BLU” or “Redeem & Stake” to get BLU.

Head over to “[Redeeming Bonds](../redeeming-bonds.md)” to redeem BLU from the bonds you have bought.
