# Bluejay Finance Overview

### What is Bluejay Finance?

Bluejay Finance is a decentralized finance protocol that aims to provide decentralized financial services to the masses by building solutions on top of decentralized local stablecoins. Our first product is a fixed income solution that provides investors with consistent and diversified returns. In addition, we offer the issuance of stablecoins pegged to real-world currencies with capital-efficient liquidity, creating new opportunities for users to transact and invest with minimized currency exchange risk.

### Why Bluejay Finance?

Bluejay Finance was founded to address the issues of financial exclusion and lack of accessibility faced by many users. Traditional financial services often impose barriers that make it difficult for certain individuals and businesses to access their services. This can include high minimum investments, complicated processes, and limited exposure to different currencies.

DeFi, or decentralized finance, has emerged as a potential solution to these issues, but it too faces certain limitations. Many stablecoin solutions only offer USD-pegged stablecoins, which restricts users' exposure to other currencies in the DeFi space. This lack of choice can be a hindrance to businesses and individuals looking to transact with minimized currency exchange risk.

Bluejay Finance seeks to solve both of these problems by offering stablecoins pegged to a range of real-world currencies on the blockchain. This provides businesses and individuals with greater flexibility and choice when it comes to transacting and investing in different assets. In addition, Bluejay Finance's decentralized fixed income product, built on top of these stablecoins, provides investors with a low-risk and low-volatility investment option that requires no minimum investment requirements or complicated KYC processes.

### How do I participate in Bluejay Finance?

Bluejay Finance offers various ways for market participants to participate in the protocol. A first strategy is fixed income investing, which allows users to invest their stablecoins in high-yield fixed income products. This offers an opportunity for investors to achieve their investment goals by providing access to a variety of financial products that may have been previously inaccessible due to high minimum investment sizes or accreditation requirements.

The second strategy is staking, which allows users to stake their BLU tokens in exchange for more BLU tokens. Another strategy is bonding, which involves providing liquidity or DAI tokens in exchange for discounted BLU after a vesting period. 

Finally, users can participate in growing the protocol by partaking in governance on the community discord. Bluejay Finance welcomes any help and initiatives to support and grow the protocol to one that the world deserves.

### How can I benefit from Bluejay Finance?

#### Investors

Investors can benefit from Bluejay Finance by experiencing consistent returns of 7%+ and diversifying their portfolios with our fixed income solutions. Our solutions are designed to deliver high returns without the volatility of the market, offering access to an asset class typically reserved for institutions and high net-worth individuals. The best part is that there is no minimum investment required, making our solutions accessible to all. By investing in Bluejay Finance, investors can expect to achieve their desired returns while diversifying their portfolios with a low-risk asset class.

#### Stakers

Stakers are aligned to the overall growth of the entire protocol. When there are more bonders, stakers, and stablecoin users, more value is generated for the protocol through bond sales and transaction fees on liquidity pools which in turn backs the value of BLU.

As a staker, you benefit from the supply growth when the protocol mints BLU tokens for distribution. Staked BLU is automatically compounded every second, this means a staker who is staking BLU over a longer period of time will have exponentially higher rewards than those staking for a short period of time. This ensures that firm believers of the protocol are hugely rewarded and there is the least value leaked toward stakers who are here for a short-term gain.

#### Bonders

Bonders are critical in the overall protocol growth and price stability of stablecoin by introducing more liquidity and assets to the protocol treasury or helping bring the stablecoins to peg, in exchange for a direct discount on the BLU token.

As a bonder, you benefit from the direct discounts on the BLU by committing your assets upfront. The BLU will be redeemable at a set point in time and realized profits will depend on the BLU price when the bond matures.

#### Stablecoin Users

Stablecoin users are users or protocols which use the different stablecoins minted by Bluejay. They benefit from having the flexibility of choosing what currency exposure they will like to have. These stablecoins are fully backed by the protocol's liquidity and can be redeemed for reserve assets on the decentralized exchanges anytime.

As a stablecoin user, you benefit from a rent-free stablecoin with deep liquidity. These stablecoins are not yield-bearing in nature but could be used as primitives in other protocols that support savings, lending & borrowing, or asset management.

Bluejay welcomes collaboration from protocols & businesses that would like to diversify their risk, provide users who prefer different underlying assets on their investments, or grow DeFi adoption in various countries.
