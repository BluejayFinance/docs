You can learn more about [Lending core concepts here](https://docs.bluejay.finance/bluejay-earn-core-concepts/lenders).

As an investor, you have the opportunity to earn interest on your bluSGD holdings by participating in loan pools. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to start investing bluSGD.

### **Before Investing bluSGD**

Before investing bluSGD, it is important to first connect your wallet to the Bluejay Finance dapp and ensure that you have bluSGD in your wallet.

Follow these guides if you haven’t already done so:

* [Connecting Your Wallet](https://docs.bluejay.finance/user-guides/connecting-your-wallet)
* [Buying bluSGD](https://docs.bluejay.finance/user-guides/buying-and-selling-blusgd)

### **Navigating to Bluejay Earn**

Once you have bluSGD and ETH in your wallet, let’s go to “**Earn**” in the left menu or head over directly to the link: [https://app.bluejay.finance/earn](https://app.bluejay.finance/lend).

\
You should see something like the following: this is where you will be able to find different loan pools available for investing.

You will find general information about each available pool on the Earn page. This information includes

* Est. Interest APR
* Payment Frequency
* Tenure
* Status

The estimated interest APR is the expected return on investment for investing in the pool, expressed as a percentage over the course of a year.

Payment frequency refers to how often the borrower is required to make payments on their loan, which in turn affects how often investors will receive payments.

Tenure is the length of time the borrower has to repay their loan,

and status indicates whether the pool is currently open for new investments or if it has been fully invested.

By reviewing this information, you can evaluate each pool and decide which one is the best fit for your investment goals.

### **Navigating to Loan Details**

You can simply click on the interested borrower pool to go directly into a specific loan pool that you’d like to learn more.

When reviewing the borrower pool details, it is essential to carefully read the information provided on the Overview, Projected Repayment Schedule, Activity Log, and Risk Disclosure sections.

The Overview section provides a high-level summary of the borrower's project, while the Projected Repayment Schedule outlines the expected payment amounts and dates for the loan. The Activity Log provides a detailed history of the investors and borrower's interactions with the platform, giving you additional insight into their reliability and trustworthiness.\
Finally, the Risk Disclosure section outlines any potential risks associated with the borrower's project.

\
It is important to review all of this information thoroughly to ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of the borrower's project and can make informed decisions about your investment. By taking the time to review these sections, you can mitigate any potential risks and maximize your chances of a successful investment.

### **Approving bluSGD**

After reviewing the information about the investment pool and deciding to invest, the first step is to approve bluSGD. This is typically required the first time you invest in a pool.\
This step allows the platform to access your bluSGD balance and use it to fund your investment.

Follow the instructions below to approve bluSGD.

1. Click on “**Approve bluSGD**”, note that this is a one-time transaction to allow spending on bluSGD for investing in loan pools.
