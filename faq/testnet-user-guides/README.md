## Bluejay Finance Testnet: How you can help&#x20;

Bluejay Finance is finally on testnet (Rinkeby) and the team is very excited for you to be the early testers of the protocol! Bluejay Finance is the first Asia-focused protocol for decentralized stablecoins pegged to local fiat currencies.

The introduction of USD stablecoins has allowed individuals and businesses to gain access to a variety of financial services like money exchanges, savings,etc. However, 99% of stablecoin solutions are centred around USD which means that users do not have a choice of having exposure to currencies other than USD in the DeFi space.&#x20;

At Bluejay, our mission is to mirror the foreign exchange market in the fiat world onto the blockchain, in order to accelerate financial inclusion and access to DeFi for all users and businesses.

Through a beta launch, we will be deploying a mirrored version of our protocol, with a full functionality of the features we'll have on mainnet (e.g., buying treasury bonds, staking $BLU tokens). Throughout the testnet we will be gathering user feedback and making frequent updates to enhance the user experience and performance of the protocol.&#x20;

Please follow the [user guides](connecting-to-rinkeby-network.md) to run through all functionalities of the protocol and you are welcome to provide feedback and comments on our [discord](https://discord.gg/4DMsg555KT) channel.\
**Letâ€™s build this together!**
