# Buying BLU (for whitelisted)

### **Buying BLU for whitelisted wallets**

If your wallet is whitelisted to buy BLU, Congratulations! \
Head over to [https://app.bluejay.finance/sale](https://app.bluejay.finance/sale)\
Then, you should see something like the following.

You can see that your wallet is whitelisted so that you can buy BLU at a discounted price for your allocated amount.

Moreover, you can easily see how many **BLU tokens left** for this token sale. And can check your **Whitelisted Allocation** and **BLU purchases**.

Let’s go ahead and buy BLU.

### **Approving DAI to purchase BLU**

Even though you have DAI in your wallet, you will first have to approve DAI to proceed the process.

Follow the instructions below to approve DAI:

1. Click on “Approve DAI” in this token sale page.

Note that this is a one-time transaction to allow spending of DAI for buying BLU tokens. Make sure you have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet for gas fees.
