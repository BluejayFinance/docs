# Getting DAI/bluSGD LP Tokens

## Why do we need LP Tokens?

To purchase a DAI/bluSGD LP Treasury Bond, we need to provide liquidity on Uniswap using DAI and bluSGD tokens. Therefore before purchasing LP Treasury bonds, make sure you have obtained DAI and bluSGD tokens in your wallet.

## Getting DAI/BLU LP Token

Follow these steps to get the DAI/bluSGD LP token:

1. Go to Bluejay testnet site “Dashboard” and click on “Wallet” in the top right corner.

Then proceed to follow the same steps you did to get DAI/BLU LP tokens([here](getting-dai-blu-lp-tokens.md#getting-dai-blu-lp-token)).

Click on “Approve bluSGD”, and then confirm the transaction on the Metamask pop-up.

Then click on “Supply” and approve the transaction through the Metamask pop-up.
